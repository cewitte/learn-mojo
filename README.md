# learn-mojo
Code for freeCodeCamp's YouTube video [Mojo Programming Language â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/5Sm9IVMet9c?si=IVlbAj6FuW5Ffavx).

This repository contains basic Mojo source code for reference and learning purposes.

Below goes a little explanation on folders and their contents.
<br>

## :file_folder: hello-world
Contains a hello world that includes importing Python libraries and reading from user input on the terminal.
<br>

## :file_folder: if-else-statements
Exactly as it says: a simple `if` with `else` and `elif` usage. 
<br>

## :file_folder: loops
Usage of `for` and `while` loops.
<br>

## :file_folder: simulating-arrays
As of now, Mojo does not support arrays yet. This code shows how to import and use `PythonObject` to simulate an array through an object.
<br>

## :file_folder: functions
The same function in Python and Mojo syntax, with some minor differences like, in Mojo, you should be explicit (i.e. Int8) whenever possible.
<br>

## :file_folder: objects
How to create classes, comparing Python and Mojo. Take a look at `main.py` and `main.mojo`.
<br>

# How to run the examples
Assuming you have Mojo installed, go to each folder and run from the terminal:

```mojo main.mojo```

You can also `mojo build [options] <path>` to create [executable files](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/cli/build.html#synopsis) if you really want to.

For the few Python files, it should be like `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` for earlier versions of Python.
