# learn-mojo
Code for freeCodeCamp's YouTube video [Mojo Programming Language â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/5Sm9IVMet9c?si=IVlbAj6FuW5Ffavx).

This repository contains basic Mojo source code for reference and learning purposes.

Below goes a little explanation on folders and their contents.

## :file_folder: hello-world
Contains a hello world that includes importing Python libraries and reading from user input on the terminal.

## :file_folder: if-else-statements
Exactly as it says: a simple ```if``` with ```else``` and ```elif``` usage. 

## :file_folder: loops
Usage of ```for``` and ```while``` loops.

## :file_folder: simulating-arrays
As of now, Mojo does not support arrays yet. This code shows how to import and use ```PythonObject``` to simulate an array through an object.

## :file_folder: functions
The same function in Python and Mojo syntax, with some minor differences like, in Mojo, you should be explicit (i.e. Int8) whenever possible.

## :file_folder: objects
How to create classes, comparing Python and Mojo. Take a look at ```main.py``` and ```main.mojo```.

# How to run the examples
Assuming you have Mojo installed, go to each folder and run from the terminal:

```mojo main.mojo```

For the few Python files, it should be like ```python3 main.py```or ```python main.py```for earlier versions of Python.
